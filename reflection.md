## Reflection
#### Useful features of our app:
- Our app has a nice interaction feature that helps efficiently retrieve the information that users need. By clicking the area name from the drop-down menu, the selected area will be highlighted on the map. The corresponding bars that show the count of the squirrel from the other two plots, will also be highlighted at the same time. 

- The dropdown menu also allows users to select multi-area that they want to compare the density of the distribution of the squirrels. The interaction feature also applies when users are doing multi-selection.

- The tooltips on the bar chart show the exact count of the squirrel in that area. Users don't need to measure the length of the bars and eyeball to get a rough number by themselves.

- The squirrel counts bars are sorted in ascending order from top to bottom, which helps users easily find a place that has the most or least amount of squirrels.

#### Things need to be fixed or improved:
- The tooltip on the map only shows the area's number instead of its name. It is not showing the count of squirrel either. Ideally, we would like to have the area's longitude, latitude, name of that area and the count of squirrel in that area in the tooltip of the map.

- The layout could be much well-organized, with two plots displayed side by side.

- The font size could be bigger.
